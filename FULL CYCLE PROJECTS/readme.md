# CATEGORY DESCRIPTION
In this this section, I use the Data Science full cycle to undertake the projects. Particularly, I employ the CRISPM-DM framework as a guide.


## THE CRISP-DM FRAMEWORK
The CRISP-DM Framework is an accepted and approved framework that serves as a guide for Data Science projects. It entails the Data Science full life cycle.

CRISP-DM is an abbreviation that stands for Cross-Industry Standard Pracrice for Data Mining

The Stages in the framework are;
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

## TOOLS
The only tool used in these projects is Python.


## PROJECT CATEGORY
I group these projects into ;
- Data Analysis Projects  
- Machine Learning Projects.
