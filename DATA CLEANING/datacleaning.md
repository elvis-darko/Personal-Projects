# CATEGORY DESCRIPTION
In this data cleaning project, I use a step by step approach to clean and prepare clumsy datasets.

I document each of the step taken and try to explain the reason for that step.


## TOOLS
In these projects, there are tools that I use for the cleaning of data.

Each project is undertaken with a designated tool.

The tools for the cleaning are;

- Excel (including Power Query)
- SQL
- Python
