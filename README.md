# REPOSITORY DESCRIPTION
 This repository contains sample projects that I undertook during my spare and practice times.
 In this Project Session, I work on projects in Excel, Power BI, SQL and Python.

I categorise projects into Data Cleaning, Analytics, Data Visualizations and Full Cycle projects.

## DATA CLEANING
In these project, I use a step by step approach to clean and prepare a clumsy dataset.

I document each of the step taken and try to explain the reason for that step.

## ANALYTICS
In these project, I ask questions from  given datasets. These datasets will be usually cleaned. In the event where the data is not cleaned, I clean and preapre it.

I analyze these datasets and answer the questions to gain valuable insights that can be used for strategic decision making.

## DATA VISUALIZATIONS
In these projects, I tell stories from the given datasets using visualizatiions. Particularly, I adopt Microsoft Power BI, Matplotlib and Seaborn for these visualizations.

Then, I provide summary notes with insightd using markdown.


## FULL CYCLE PROJECTS
In this this section, I use the Data Science full cycle to undertake the projects. Particularly, I employ the CRISPM-DM framework as a guide.

I sub-categorize these projects into Data Analysis and Machine Learning projects.
