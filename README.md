# REPOSITORY DESCRIPTION
 This repository sample projects that I undertook during my spare and practice times.
 In this Project Session, I work on projects in Excel, Power BI, SQL and Python.

I categorise projects into Data Cleaning, Analytics, Data Visualizations and Full Cycle projects.

## DATA CLEANING
In these projects, I use a step by step approach to clean and prepare clumsy datasets.

I document each of the steps taken and try to explain the reason for that step.

## ANALYTICS
In these projects, I ask questions from  given datasets. These datasets will be usually cleaned. In the event where the data is not cleaned, I clean and preapre it.

I analyze these datasets and answer the questions to gain valuable insights that can be used for strategic decision making.

## DATA VISUALIZATION
In these projects, I tell stories from the given datasets using visualizations. Particularly, I adopt Microsoft Power BI, Matplotlib and Seaborn for these visualizations. 

In the near future, I will be using Tableau for other visualizations.

Then, I provide summary notes with insights using markdown cells or readme files.


## FULL CYCLE PROJECTS
In this section, I use the Data Science full cycle to undertake the projects. Particularly, I employ the CRISPM-DM framework as a guide.

I sub-categorize these projects into Data Analysis and Machine Learning projects.
