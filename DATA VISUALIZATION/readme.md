# CATEGORY DESCRIPTION
In these projects, I tell stories from the given datasets using visualizations. Particularly, I adopt Microsoft Power BI, Excel, Matplotlib and Seaborn for these visualizations. 

Where I use jupyter notebooks for visualizations, I create a markdown cell in which I note insights and recommendations.

In the event that I use Microsoft Power BI and Excel for visualizations, I note down insights and recommendations in the readme files of the projects.
